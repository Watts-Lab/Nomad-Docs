# NOMAD: Scalable GPS Mobility Analysis

Welcome to the NOMAD documentation site. NOMAD is an open-source platform designed for scalable analysis of GPS trajectory data and mobility metrics computation.

## This documentation includes:
- **Setup instructions**: Environment setup and dependencies to get started.
- **Data loading and filtering**: Learn how to load and preprocess raw GPS data.
- **Stop detection algorithms**: Identify stationary periods in mobility trajectories using rule-based and clustering methods.
- **Synthetic data generation**: Simulate GPS mobility data for testing and prototyping.
